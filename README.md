## About the Project

CupcakeCorner, a project developed for the Day 52 challenge in the "100 Days with SwiftUI" course, is an app designed to showcase the power of SwiftUI in handling web requests, form validations, and more. Through the app, users can order custom cupcakes, choosing flavors, quantity, and additional decorations. Key features like loading images from a remote server, form validation, and sending/receiving Codable data with URLSession demonstrate the app's integration with web technologies.

### Features

- **Custom Cake Ordering:** Users can select cake flavors, quantity, and specify special requests such as extra frosting or sprinkles.
- **Remote Image Loading:** Demonstrates loading an image from a remote server to provide a visual representation of the cupcakes.
- **Form Validation:** Ensures that all user input is valid before allowing the order to be placed, including checking for a valid address.
- **Networking:** Uses URLSession to send and receive orders over the internet, showcasing how to handle Codable data in a SwiftUI application.

### Learning Highlights

This project focuses on advanced SwiftUI and Swift topics, including:
- Networking with URLSession to send and receive Codable data.
- Implementing form validation to ensure the user input is correct before proceeding.
- Loading images from a remote server to provide a richer user interface.
- Adding Codable conformance to an @Observable class to facilitate data storage and retrieval.
